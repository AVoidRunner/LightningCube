# LightningCube
Summons a series of lightning strikes in a customizable cube pattern. Automatically adapts to any terrain.

Uses the command /lightning and summons lightning in a cube where each side is x blocks long.
Example: "/lightning 12" Summons a cube of lightning strikes with a 12x12 area of effect.

Adpats to the terrain. If the terrain is higher or lower than the player it'll strike where it would if it was natural lightning.
